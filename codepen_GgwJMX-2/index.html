  <h1> Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
<b> How The Web Works</b>
<p> <b>The Web</b> consists of several compuetrs and servers that work together to allow us to <em>surf</em> the web.When we type in a 
<b>Url</b> like <a href="www.udacity.com"> www.udacity.com </a>,our computer sends a request known as an <b>HTTP</b> request , to a server .
The server then  finds the 
<em>HTML</em> document or file and sends it back to our computer.</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> This consists of text content"<em>visual</em>",markup,"<em>what it looks like</em>",and references, images, and <em>links</em> to other pages,<em>etc...</em> 
Some componets of <em>HTML </em> are <em><b>tags,elements,and attributes.</b></em> It is not important
  to remember all of the tags because simply "<em>Programmers can't remember everything"</em>. You can easiy reference them by <b>google</b> of course.
</p>
<b>Coding</b>
<p><em>Coding</em> works when programmers write text in a language that a computer understands.
<em>Computers are stupid</em>, so programmers need to write excatly the way a computer understands (<em>also known as the correct <b>syntax</b></em>).</p>
